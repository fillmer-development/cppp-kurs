c)

Recursion in makros will not work, because it would replace a function call (FAC for instance) with its body, in which the same function would be called again, but is still not defined.

If the prepocessor will go over the text only once, there will be a null pointer exception caused by the undefinend function call. Otherwise, the prepocessor would not terminate, because it does not perform any checks to break the recursion.
